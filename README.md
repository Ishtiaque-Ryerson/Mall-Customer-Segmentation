•	Yellow Cluster - The yellow cluster groups young people with moderate to low annual income who actually spend a lot.
•	Red Cluster - This cluster groups reasonably young people with medium to high income who spend a lot.
•	Purple Cluster - The purple cluster basically groups people of all ages whose salary isn't pretty high and their spending score is medium or average.
•	Orange Cluster - The orange cluster groups people who actually have medium to high income (similar to a red cluster) but barely spend money; their age usually lays between   thirty and sixty years.
•	Blue Cluster - The blue cluster groups whose income is very low and don't spend much money in stores, and they are people of all ages.
